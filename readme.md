## About the project

### 🎯 Objectives

<ol>
  <li><strong>Analyze</strong> NodeJS, Express and Sequelize</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment</strong> using this methods to build a Ecommerce Backend .</li>
  <li><strong>Optimize</strong> the user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Integrate</strong> NodeJS to enhance interactivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Customize</strong> and adapt styles.</li>
</ol>


### 🔬 Methodology

<strong>Research and experimentation:</strong> i've gathered relevant information about  NodeJS, Express, and Sequelize from reliable sources. Then, we applied these concepts in examples and projects to explore the capabilities of Node. I compared and evaluated the results obtained in different contexts.

<strong>Practical experimentation:</strong> I created a development environment and carried out a series of examples and projects to apply the learned concepts and explore the capabilities of CRUD.

<strong>Analysis and comparison:</strong> I compared and evaluated the results obtained by using Sequelize to create tables with content in NodeJS

<strong>Documentation:</strong> I maintained a detailed record of our research process, including the steps followed, the problems encountered, and the implemented solutions.


## 🧠 Conclusions

<p>In conclusion, this research project has allowed me to explore and deeply understand the potential of CRUD in combination with NodeJS to understand how the backend part of the website works. </p>
